# Welcome to ESPRI-MOD documentation

The objectives of ESPRI-MOD's activities are to manage, share, open up and promote the research

 CERFACS. In this respect, ESPRI-MOD is in charge of the strategy for these issues within the 
 ClimERI research infrastructure. The challenges facing ESPRI-MOD are of several kinds.

You will find below the documented operational procedures of the services operated by the 
IPSL's ESPRI-MOD team. These procedures apply to IPSL environement.
